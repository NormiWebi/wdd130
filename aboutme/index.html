    <h2>Norman Baker</h2>
    <h2>Jay</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, My name is Norman, often called Jay in short for Junior because my Dad is the senior and I'm from a small island called Jamaica. I served a mission in the Canada Calgary Mission from 2019 to 2021.</p>
    </p>I also work as a Peer Mentor for Bloom, which serves online degree students at BYU-Idaho & Ensign College, just like myself.</p>
    </p>I enjoy photographing, food, exploring the outdoors, and spending time at the beach. I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and viewing your webpages.</p>
